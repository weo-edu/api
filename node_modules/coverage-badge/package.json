Does what it says on the tin. \n\n![100% coverage](https://raw.github.com/PPvG/node-coverage-badge/master/example/100.png) ![95% coverage](https://raw.github.com/PPvG/node-coverage-badge/master/example/95.png) ![85% coverage](https://raw.github.com/PPvG/node-coverage-badge/master/example/85.png)\n\nWorks like this:\n\n    $ node coverage-badge 95 coverage.png\n\n... or like this:\n\n    var fs = require('fs');\n    var badge = require('coverage-badge');\n\n    var coverage = /* read coverage from JSON or whatever */;\n    var file = fs.createWriteStream('coverage.png');\n\n    badge(coverage).pipe(file);\n\nTie it in with build tool and let your continuous integration tool call that build step and archive the image.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nAn example: [node-aether](https://github.com/PPvG/node-aether) uses Drone.io as CI server and `slake` as build tool. The relevant build step runs `jscoverage` to instrument, then runs `mocha` to generate a JSON code coverage report, and then uses that to generate the coverage badge. That last bit looks like this (rewritten from the original LiveScript):\n\n    var badge = require('coverage-badge');\n\n    task 'cov-badge', function() {\n      /* [run jscoverage...] */\n      /* [run mocha...] */\n      mocha.on('close'), function() {\n        var json = require('./coverage.json');\n        var file = fs.createWriteStream('./coverage.png');\n        badge(json.coverage).pipe(file);\n      }\n    }\n\nAt each build, Drone.io runs these commands:\n\n    sudo apt-get install jscoverage\n    slake cov-badge\n\n... and then saves `./coverage.png` as a **build artefact**. The image can then be found under the Downloads tab. The result:\n[![Code Coverage for node-aether](https://drone.io/github.com/PPvG/node-aether/files/coverage.png)](https://github.com/PPvG/node-aether)\n\nVisual theme\n------------\n\nCurrently it pretty much mimics the look of the Drone.io badge. Other styles may be added in the future.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n    npm install coverage-badge\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSimplified BSD (2-clause).\n",
